# Python Iceberg

Scope: A series targeted at **early intermediate Python users** who want to
deepen their understanding of Python and computer science. Not targeting any
specific *skill* as an end goal but *understanding* instead. Concepts will be
approached from the perspective of Python but will be intended to be general
enough to deepen your understanding of computer science as a whole.

Non-goals: To be a handheld tutorial on how to do specific tasks.

Key pain point: Python tutorials will tell you *how* to do some thing without
explaining *why* you do it.

Prerequisites:
* Beginner Python
    - Basic data structures
    - Basic control flow
    - Basic procedural programming
    - Maybe some basic OOP
* (TBD)

Candidate topics
* The VM
    - Compiled vs interpreted languages
    - Bytecode
* Procedural programming
    - "Procedures" vs "functions"
    - Stack frames
* The type system
* The modules & packaging ecosystem
